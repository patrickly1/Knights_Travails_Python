# Knights_Travails_Python

• Implemented a chess knight path-finding algorithm using Breadth-First Search, implemented in Python.
• Managed traversal using a queue, tracking visited nodes and predecessors to reconstruct the shortest path.
• Developed node and graph structures with boundary checks for valid moves, optimizing pathfinding.
• Constructed the shortest path from start to end by mapping predecessors and reversing the path upon completion.
